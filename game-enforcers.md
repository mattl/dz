The Enforcers are the Council of Seven’s elite peacekeepers, dispatched to tackle threats that are beyond the scope of regular military units. Each Enforcer is a superior soldier, trained in countless forms of combat and equipped with the best technology available. As a unit they are disciplined and fearless, ready to lay down their lives to carry out the orders of their captain. When a Containment Protocol is decreed, multiple Enforcers patrols are sent to the planet’s surface to retrieve important tech, repel raiders and terminate priority targets. Although they may be outnumbered, they will never be outgunned.

Below is a sample of the different soldiers available to a Commander to form part of their Strike Team:

<p>It takes utter dedication to the cause just to survive more than a handful of missions and Enforcers who rise through the ranks to command positions have almost superhuman levels of skill, endurance and the most advanced personal armour available to the forces of humanity. </p>
