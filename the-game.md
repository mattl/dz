Deadzone is the exciting tabletop miniatures game where two Strike Teams do battle in the depths of an urban battlezone.

<strong>Fast, furious firefights</strong> - Command a Strike Team of between 5-15 miniatures to achieve secret objectives. Capture vital intel, assasinate the enemy commander or simply obliterate the opposing force from the battlefield! 

<strong>Build your Strike Team</strong> - Select your team from one of seven factions and play battles using the games' deep campaign system which will see your squad of basic troopers grow in number, gain new equipment and earn special abilities!

<strong>True Line of Sight</strong> - See what you can shoot using the game's intuitive and engaging mechanics.

<strong>Interactive 3D Battlefield</strong> - Play on a fully modular battlefield using the hard plastic Battlezones terrain tile system. Construct everything from towers to bunkers, walkways to entire space-stations using the versatile range. Add in a range of accessories and lootable equipment on the battlefield and you have a truly 3D gaming space as high quality as your miniatures.

<strong>The War Escalates!</strong> - Expand your battles with exciting rules such as Multi-Mat, Multiplayer and the solo Zombie campaign!

<strong>Deep, compelling narrative</strong> - Set in the Warpath universe, focus in on the regions of space designated a Deadzone and discover the horrors that have befallen planets such as Nexus Psi and Exham IV.
