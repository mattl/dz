When Jesus Ortiz came up with a simple game to keep his troops
entertained between battles, he could hardly have guessed at the
success that his new invention would quickly gather throughout the
whole of the GCPS.

What started in the rusty hold of a corporation warship has exploded
into a galaxy-wide phenomenon, with leagues and tournaments of various
levels played out the length and breadth of the GCPS, all under the
watchful control of the DGB. The game has taken spectacle to whole new
heights, with enormous stadiums seating hundreds of thousands of fans,
star players with armies of fanatically devoted spectators and
Corporate sponsorship that runs into numbers even a Forge Father would
have trouble counting.

But there are those who don’t follow the official game. Those who
either can’t afford or don’t want to toe the DGB line. These people
find other ways to satiate their love of violence and sport, in dark
corners far removed from the spotlight and fanfare of the arenas, and
more importantly, far away from the prying eyes of the DGB
itself. These people are responsible for the most violent, underground
and dangerous form of DreadBall to exist -- DreadBall Xtreme.

Xtreme matches are by necessity much more informal affairs than their
officially sanctioned counterparts. The authorities – both the DGB and
the Council, to say nothing of the corporations themselves – take an
understandably dim view of the practice, and are ever eager to catch
the perpetrators. Matches are arranged in great secrecy, generally
between the sponsors themselves, who will agree on a location
sometimes only minutes before a match is due to begin.

Taking place in abandoned warehouses, prison basements and even the
holds of starships, matches usually play out over an area littered
with obstacles and traps to catch the unwary – some left deliberately,
others simply the result of a hurried clearing of a space large enough
to play in. The players themselves lack the sophisticated, purpose
built armour and equipment of their more glamorous counterparts,
wearing whatever they can scrounge, borrow or steal. Indeed, it is not
uncommon for DBX players to take to the pitch with no armour at
all. It is a sport where casualties occur often and bloodily, which is
all to the good as far as the spectators are concerned.
